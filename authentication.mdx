## API Keys

All API requests require an API key passed in the Authorization header. API keys can be created in your [Viggle Dashboard](https://viggle.ai/dashboard).

## Authentication Header

Include your API key in every request using the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.viggle.ai/api/characters" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```


```python Python
import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.viggle.ai/api/characters",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
print(response.json())
```


```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch("https://api.viggle.ai/api/characters", {
  headers: {
    "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
  }
});
const data = await response.json();
```

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Keep your API key secure**

  Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. API keys should only be used in server-side applications.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables instead of hardcoding it in your source code.

    ```bash
    export VIGGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
    ```

    ```python
    import os
    api_key = os.environ.get("VIGGLE_API_KEY")
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rotate keys regularly">
    Periodically rotate your API keys, especially if you suspect they may have been compromised.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use separate keys for environments">
    Use different API keys for development, staging, and production environments.
  </Accordion>

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```

Common authentication errors:

| Error              | Cause                              | Solution                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key         | Check that you're including the Authorization header with a valid key |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Expired API key                    | Generate a new API key in your dashboard                              |
| `403 Forbidden`    | API key lacks required permissions | Contact support if you need elevated permissions                      |
